# Description
Travel Tide, the online platform for travel itinerary. It is believed to offer the largest travel inventory in the industry. The company faces a main challenge in customer retention.     
The top executives believe that understanding customer behaviour and offering rewards in terms of perks can be a fruitful strategy in retaining customers.

1. 1 night free hotel with flight
2. Free hotel meal
3. Free checked bag
4. Exclusive discounts
5. No cancellation fees

# Objective
The broad aim of the project is to understand customer behaviour and segment in different clusters.    
Based on this segmentation, offer one of the predefined perks to each segment.     

# Methodology
1. **Data cleaning and processing**: The raw data was extracted and filtered to contain sessions after 04 January 2024 and users with more than 7 sessions. The data was cleaned using Postgresql.  
2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: EDA was doen using Postresql and Tableau.  
3. **Segmentation**: Multiple features were used to understand customer behaviour. Rule based approach was used to define customer segments based on the analysed features. Each customer segment was assigned one perks based on the analysis of customer beahviour from each segment. 
4. **Visualisation**: Visualisations were created using Tableau 
  
# Key findings
1. Least number of users eligible for most valuable perk of "1 night free hotel with flight".  
2. Maximum users are eligible for "Free checked baggage perk".  
3. Women travllers outnumbered men travellers in all segments.  
4. Mid age (31-50 years) travellers account for almost 60% of all travellers.
