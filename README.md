# Objective
The broad aim of the project is to understand customer behaviour and segment them into different clusters.    
Based on this segmentation, one of the predefined perks is offered to each segment.     

# Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Processing**: The raw data was extracted and filtered to contain sessions after 04 January 2024 and users with more than 7 sessions. The data was cleaned using Postgresql.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA was done using PostgreSQL and Tableau.  
3. **Segmentation**: Multiple features were used to understand customer behaviour. A rule-based approach was used to define customer segments based on the analysed features. Each customer segment was assigned one perk based on the analysis of customer behaviour within each segment.
4. **Visualisation**: Visualisations were created using Tableau 
  
# Key findings
1. Least number of users eligible for most valuable perk of "1 night free hotel with flight".  
2. Maximum users are eligible for "Free checked baggage perk".  
3. Women travllers outnumbered men travellers in all segments.  
4. Mid-age (31-50 years) travellers account for almost 60% of all travellers.  
5. One-third of all users are mid-age women solo travellers.  

# Recommendations
1. Validation of segmentation by other methods such as A/B testing is recommended.  
2. It is recommended to collect customer feedback about the services and improve understanding of customer behaviour.  
3. Strategic changes to attract more men as well as young age users are recommended.  

# Tools used
**SQL**: Data extraction, filtering, cleaning and analysis  
**Tableau**: Visualisation and analysis
